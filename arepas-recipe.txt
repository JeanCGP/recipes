DIRECTIONS
For Arepas: Adjust your oven racks to the upper- middle and lower-middle positions and preheat the oven to 350°F. Whisk together the corn flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.
Whisk the butter into 21/2 cups of water, then add it to the flour mixture, stirring until well combined. The dough will start out loose but the flour quickly absorbs the liquid. Start to knead the dough in the bowl and once it becomes very soft and doesn’t stick to your hands, after about 8 minutes, the dough is ready to be shaped (if, while kneading, the dough seems too stiff and breaks apart, add a few tablespoons of hot water; if it is too sticky, add a little more corn flour).
